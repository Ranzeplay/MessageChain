# MessageChain

A Minecraft fabric mod allows developers to interact with server resources like calling web API.

I hope this mod can simplify your development process dealing with networking.

## Features

- [x] Routing: Merge push and pull actions into one. (since v0.1)
- [x] Notification: Receive server-side notifications. (since v0.2)
- [ ] Data synchronization: Synchronize client-server data. (object-based)
- [ ] PlayerBridge: Communicate directly between players.
- [ ] Form: Ask player to fill in a form by showing a game screen, transmitting the result back when player finished filling.

## Testing

### Routing

### Notifications
