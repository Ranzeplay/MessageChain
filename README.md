# MessageChain

A Minecraft fabric mod allows developers to interact with server resources like calling web API.

I hope this mod can simplify your development process dealing with networking.

## Features

- [x] Routing: Merge push and pull actions into one (since v0.1)
- [x] Notification: Receive server-side notifications (since v0.2)
- [ ] Data synchronization: Synchronize client-server data (object-based)
- [ ] PlayerBridge: Communicate directly between players

## Testing

### Routing

Run command `/msgc_test_routing`, there will be an output if success.

### Notifications

Run command `/msgc_test_notification`, there will be an output if success.

## Road map

### v1 (Next version)

Basic data processing

### v2

Data synchronization

### v3

`PlayerBridge`, which allows sending messages to a player directly.
