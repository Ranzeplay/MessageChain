# Routing

:::info

Since v0.1-beta

:::

This is a core feature oF MessageChain that allows you to request a server-side registered route and get a result from server.

<details>
<summary>What will you have to do without Routing</summary>

Without using Routing, you would have to code like this

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="client-side" label="Client side">

```java title="ClientAnnouncementNetworking.java"
private static void pullLatestAnnouncements() {
    var packet = PacketByteBufs.create();
    packet.writeShort(5);
    ClientPlayNetworking.send(AnnouncementIdentifier.PULL_ANNOUNCEMENT_REQUEST, packet);
}

private static void receiveLatestAnnouncements(MinecraftClient client, PacketByteBuf packetByteBuf) {
    assert client.player != null;
    var data = Objects.requireNonNull(packetByteBuf.readNbt());
    var dataList = data.getList("announcements", NbtElement.COMPOUND_TYPE);
    client.player.sendMessage(Text.literal(String.format("Displaying latest %d announcement(s)", dataList.size())));
    for (int i = 0; i < dataList.size(); i++) {
        var entry = dataList.getCompound(i);
        var announcement = new AnnouncementViewModel(entry);
        client.player.sendMessage(Text.literal(announcement.toString()));
    }
}

    var count = packetByteBuf.readShort();
    var result = new NbtList();
    var dbItems = AnnouncementManager.getInstance().getLatest(count);

    dbItems.stream()
            .map(AnnouncementViewModel::new)
            .forEach(a -> result.add(a.toNbt()));

    var nbt = new NbtCompound();
    nbt.put("announcements", result);
    ServerPlayNetworking.send(sender, AnnouncementIdentifier.PULL_ANNOUNCEMENT_REPLY, PacketByteBufs.create().writeNbt(nbt));
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is so ugly because you have to use at least TWO methods to achieve one function, getting a list of announcements from server.

## Process

In short, refer to this [link](https://github.com/Ranzeplay/MessageChain/tree/v0.2/src/main/java/me/ranzeplay/messagechain/testing) to view the example source code.

### Server-side route registration

MessageChain will setup a `RemoteRouteManager` on initialization. To register your route, use the following code to do that.

```java
RemoteRouteManager.getInstance().registerRoute(routeHandler);
```

Parameter `routeHandler` is a `me.ranzeplay.messagechain.models.routing.RouteHandler` instance, which consists of the type of payload,
the type of data returned when successfully processed the request, data type returned when failed to process it, the path of the route,
and also the actions to process the request. Constructor as follows:

```java
new RouteHandler<>(Class<TPayload>, Class<TSuccess>, Class<TFail>, Identifier, AbstractRouteExecutor);
```

- `Identifier` is a Minecraft identifier.
- `AbstractRouteExecutor` is basically a `Function<T, R>` interface.

### Client-side route invocation

Once you have registered a `RouteHandler` on server-side, you can call it from client-side.
There are 2 methods to invoke, one blocks the execution, and the other creates another thread to invoke, but a callback `Consumer<T>` is required.

If you send a request in a single player world to the internal server using the blocking method, the whole client will freeze.
So if it's available to use the other one, use the another one.

Just like mentioned above, MessageChain has set up a `LocalRequestManager` on initialization.

The blocking way:

```java
LocalRequestManager.getInstance().sendRequest(Identifier, TPayload, Class<TPayload>, Class<TFail>);
```

The non-blocking way:

```java
LocalRequestManager.getInstance().sendThreadedRequest(Identifier, TPayload, Class<TPayload>, Class<TFail>, Consumer<RouteResponse<TSuccess, TFail>>);
```

### Server-side route handling

Once the request has been sent to server, MessageChain will check if the Route does exist. If not, a `RouteFailResponse` with reason `FailType.ROUTE_NOT_FOUND` will be sent back.
Otherwise, your code will kick in.

Your code will be invoked with a `RouteRequestContext` containing request data, Minecraft server instance, sender information, and other uncommon information for you to use.

A `RouteResponse` is required to be returned, containing the execution result. Whether the operation succeed or not, why, and other data.

### Client-side callback method (only when invoked `sendThreadedRequest`)

Like what title said.

### Remove an existing route

To remove an existing route, use the following method:

```java
RemoteRouteManager.getInstance().unregisterRoute(Identifier);
```
