## Object-NbtCompound conversion

In package `me.ranzeplay.messagechain.nbtutils`

Personally speaking, it often drives me crazy to code the conversion between NbtCompound and Object.
It is hardcoded. So I made a small helper to do the favor.

### Annotations

#### `@NBTSerializable`

Every class that needs to serialize and deserialize to and from NbtCompound should have the annotation,
which indicates that the object is able to do the conversion.
Often, you'll extend `AbstractNBTSerializable` as well, because you are using MessageChain :)

#### `@NBTSerializationEntry(key)`

Every field that needs to take part in the conversion should have the annotation.
It tells the NBTHelper that it needs to process the field.

##### Parameter

- `key`
  A string value, whose default value is the name of the field, can be customized by yourself.

### Conversion methods

#### `NBTHelper.serialize(T)`

Serializes an `Object` to `NbtCompound`.

#### `NBTHelper.deserialize(NbtCompound, Class<T>)`

Deserializes a `NbtCompound` to target `Object`.

### Base types

The following types are served as base types,
which you can directly annotate with `@NBTSerializationEntry` without writing special serialization methods.

- `int`, `Integer`
- `short`, `Short`
- `long`, `Long`
- `float`, `Float`
- `double`, `Double`
- `int[]`
- `byte[]`
- `long[]`
- `boolean`, `Boolean`
- `String`
- `AbstractList` as the superclass(like ArrayList)
- `AbstractMap` as the superclass(like HashMap)

:::warning

Exceptions will be thrown if a field whose type is an abstract class is annotated as the converter will create an instance of class while processing.

### Example

Often used combined with `AbstractNBTSerializable`.

[Source file link](https://github.com/Ranzeplay/MessageChain/blob/v0.2/src/main/java/me/ranzeplay/messagechain/testing/ExampleData.java)

```java title="ExampleData.java"
public class ExampleData extends AbstractNBTSerializable implements Cloneable {
    @NBTSerializationEntry
    private String message;
    @NBTSerializationEntry
    private boolean issueError;

    @SneakyThrows
    @Override
    public NbtCompound toNbt() {
        return NBTHelper.serialize(this.clone());
    }

    @Override
    public void fromNbt(NbtCompound nbt) {
        var result = NBTHelper.deserialize(nbt, ExampleData.class);
        this.message = result.message;
        this.issueError = result.issueError;
    }

    @Override
    public Class<ExampleData> getGenericClass() {
        return ExampleData.class;
    }
}
```
