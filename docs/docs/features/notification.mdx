<details>
<summary>Why use the notification system provided by MessageChain?</summary>

It might be not so useful, 
but I think it would be better to use different methods to process different messages, 
Instead of putting them together by invoking `ServerPlayNetworking` and `ClientPlayNetworking`.

It will improve code readability.

There might be moments when you want to push something to players, so we built a simple notification system.

## Process

In short, refer to this [link](https://github.com/Ranzeplay/MessageChain/tree/v0.2/src/main/java/me/ranzeplay/messagechain/testing) to view the example source code.

### Client-side notification receiver registration

In `NotificationManager`, use the following method to register a notification receiver:

```java
NotificationManager.getInstance().registerHandler(Identifier, AbstractNotificationHandler, boolean);
```

The last parameter indicates whether the notification receiver should be removed once it has been invoked.

Be aware that the receiver will run on the main thread instead of creating a new thread, and you have no other options so far.

### Server-side notification push

On server side, use the following method to push a notification:

```java
NotificationManager.getInstance().sendNotification(Identifier, TPayload, ServerPlayerEntity);
```

The receiver must be a game client.

There will be a method to broadcast notifications in future versions (maybe in v0.3-beta).

### Remove an existing notification handler

To remove an existing notification handler, use the following method:

```java
NotificationManager.getInstance().unregisterHandler(Identifier);
```
