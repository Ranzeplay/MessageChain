# MessageChain

## Brief introduction

A Minecraft fabric mod allows developers to interact with server resources like calling web API.

I hope this mod can simplify your development process dealing with networking.

### Road map

#### v1

Basic data processing

#### v2

Data synchronization

#### v3

`PlayerBridge`, which allows sending messages to a player directly.
